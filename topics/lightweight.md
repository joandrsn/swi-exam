# A lightweight innovatio process
Focus is on here and now. A dollar today is better than a dollar tomorrow.
*RISK*: Innovation and competitive advantage decreate over time and productivity will lead to diminishing returns.

Do a lot of reactive product development.
Problem 


## Star Search
* Encourage innovation from the WHOLE organization
* Selection MUST be cost-effective to compete.
* Any more heavy weight dont stand a chance.
* !! Difference from ESSENCE: Star search is competition with short-term development. ESSENCE: Part of the development.

## Process Improvement
* Repeatability
* Predictability
* Controllability

## Part of day-to-day business
* Lightweight
* Part of day-to-day business compared to "new idea workshop".

## Product or Process innovation
* Same.
* ESSENCE: External innovation. How can we change the world of the customer.

## Star search 4 steps:
1. Call for innovation: Get a bunch of ideas
2. Audition: 30-45 min presentation of the idea.
3. Prepapration: 
4. Decision: 
Stops BEFORE realization
ESSENCE: decisions and realization GENNEM development

EVERYONE is a part of the innovation process.
